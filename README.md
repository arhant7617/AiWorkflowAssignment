**AI Workflow Engine — Minimal Graph-Based Workflow System (FastAPI)**
A lightweight workflow/graph engine built using Python and FastAPI, supporting nodes, edges, branching, looping, and simple tool execution. This project demonstrates how an “agent-like” workflow system can be structured using clean Python modules.

**Features**

1. Minimal Workflow / Graph Engine

Nodes = Python functions that read/modify shared state
Edges = Define execution order
Conditional branching
Looping until a condition is met
Clean execution log + run state tracking

2. Simple Tool Registry

Register any Python function as a tool
Nodes can call tools using the registry

3. FastAPI Endpoints

    **Endpoint**                              **Description**
POST /graph/create	                  Create a new workflow graph
POST /graph/run	                      Run the graph with an initial state
GET /graph/state/{run_id}	            Fetch current workflow state

**Installation & Running the Project**

1️. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AiWorkflowAssignment.git
cd AiWorkflowAssignment

2️. Create & Activate Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

3️. Install Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️. Run FastAPI Server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

5️. Open API Docs
Go to:
([http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs])

**Example Workflow**

The repository includes an example workflow where:

Nodes perform simple state updates
1. A tool analyzes data
2. The workflow branches based on conditions
3. A loop continues until a state value meets a threshold

Example JSON for running:
'''
{
  "graph_id": "example_graph",
  "initial_state": {
    "value": 0
  }
}
'''
